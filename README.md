# Real-time Hand Gesture Recognition using TensorFlow & OpenCV

In this machine learning project on Hand Gesture Recognition, we are going to make a real-time Hand Gesture Recognizer using the MediaPipe framework and Tensorflow in OpenCV and Python.
* MediaPipe is a customizable machine learning solutions framework developed by Google.
* TensorFlow is an open-source library for machine learning and deep learning developed by the Google brains team.
* Neural Networks are also known as artificial neural networks. It is a subset of machine learning and the heart of deep learning algorithms. The concept of Neural networks is inspired by the human brain.
